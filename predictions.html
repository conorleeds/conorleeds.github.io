        <h1>Jumbotron heading</h1>
        <p class="lead">I was sitting at home after a long, hard day’s work just beginning to enjoy the evening.  After work that day I had to run some errands so I got home later than usual.  I had to go to the store for groceries and I also swung by to pick up my dry cleaning.  I then went to the library to pick up a book that I had been hoping to read.  The library was empty and dusty.  These days it is always empty because nearly every book can be gotten on the literabrary, the electronic books on which millions of publications are stored.  However, not every book was available on the literabrary; some really old, sometimes even restricted, books were only found here in this ancient building.  I went to up to the desk and asked the robotic attendant if the book I was looking for was available.  It seemed as if I could see in its emotionless eyes the little wheels spinning as it checked its database for the book.  “Yes, let me get that for you” it answered and immediately whirled down the rows of books behind the counter.  When it returned, it had in its hand the old raggedy thing make of paper and thread, held together by old crusty glue, that I was looking for.  “Please scan your card,” its robotic voice asked.  I reached into my pocket and pulled out the identification card that we use for everything from buying food too getting into the secure sections of our workplaces.  The attendant reached over and scanned my card, said, “this is your fourth book this month, you are two away from you limit,” and handed me the musty smelling thing that I was so excited to read.
Now I sat at home with the lights on after a warm meal of soup and bread and I took the book in my hand to begin reading.  You could almost hear it groan with pain as I cracked open the cover and turned to the first page.  I began to read and lost track of time.  With each new page I got sucked further into a world that was not my own.  Suddenly, I was violently yanked out of my world of fiction by a deafening thud that vibrated my front door.  I jumped up from my chair, my heart fluttering as fast as the wings of a bee and let the book fall onto the floor with a whimper.  I began to walk cautiously toward my front door to see what could have made the monstrous noise, when another thud rang out; perfectly timed with the power being cut.  I stood still in the darkness looking at my front door.
Then, BANG! The door shattered into a million pieces and a blinding light came flooding into the room accompanied with a chaotic whirling noise, like that of some huge machinery.  I could hear large footstep approaching but was so confused by the sudden and vicious change in my environment that I couldn’t tell where they were coming from.  Suddenly my blood froze as a cold, unfeeling voice uttered “Don’t move.  You are under arrest.  If you attempt to flee you will be shot dead.  If try to bribe us, you will be shot dead.  If you resist in any physical or verbal manor, you will be shot dead.”  And I knew what stood surrounding me.
The government called them C.P.B’s or Crime Prevention Bots.  Their sole purpose was to monitor every citizen’s behavior and arrest anyone who might be a potential criminal, either now or in the future.  They were programmed with an algorithm that used a range of personal data, such as what someone bought, where they have been in the last month and other habitual patterns and matched them with known criminal activity.  If they calculated even the smallest possibility that you would commit a crime, they would arrest you.  Sometimes, innocent people would try to run, or argue that they had done nothing wrong and the C.P.B’s would just kill them and move on to their next target.  That is why the general populous called them Seek-and-Destroyers, because they hunted people down and destroyed their lives.
There was no point in anyone trying to fight the Seek-and-Destroyers.  These robots were eight feet tall and heavily armored; bulky like the professional weightlifters of old.  One arm was a huge battering ram that was strong enough to get through any door, no matter how thick.  The other had a mini-gun strapped to it with a huge spotlight connected to the end of the barrel.  Their eyes glowed with cold light, one a dark unfeeling blue, the other a bloody red.  By the way the light fell on me I could tell that the one standing directly in front of me had its gun pointed at my quivering heart.  I also could tell that there were two other Seek-and-Destroyers in the room; one on either side of me.  As my eyes adjusted to the light and my head cleared from the confusion I could see the terrifying eyes staring at me just past the end of the mini-gun. 
“Put your hands on your head and stay perfectly still.”  I could tell the one with its gun pointed at my heart, the one that shattered my door, was the one giving me the orders.  I followed its directions and slowly put my hands on my head.  The moment I felt my hair with my fingertips I heard the whirling and thudding of the one on my left coming closer.  It had crossed my living room in four steps and used its specially shaped hands to encase my own so that I couldn’t move without it causing me great pain.  It then lifted me off the ground by the hands and followed the other two bots out of my home and into the crisp night air.
I was sitting in a bright room, hands chained to a desk that seemed to grow out of the metal floor and my feet chained to the chair beneath me.  The light above wasn’t particularly bright but there was something about it that made me want to squint my eyes.  The walls and the floor were all the same grey metallic color that seemed to darken the room and yet somehow brighten the lights all the more.  I had been sitting here for what seemed like an hour before a small portion of the wall opened, wait, not the wall, it was a door.  I didn’t even realize there was a door in this room.  What surprised me the most was that the door didn’t try to blend into the wall at all, it was as obvious as any other closed door in any other room.  Why didn’t I notice it before?  Perhaps the light distracted me too much.  Or perhaps one doesn’t notice, or even care if there is a door in a room that they know there’s no hope in escaping.  A man came in through the now open door, which was closed immediately after he entered the room.  He was wearing a dark uniform and in his hand held a thin, flimsy, clear piece of plastic.  He sat down in the chair across from me placing the plastic thing in front of him.  He then opened it up like one would open a book and the thing lit up with text and pictures.  This was a literabrary.  He took the right side of the literabrary and turned it as if turning the pages of a book and the screen inside changed with it.
Finally he looked up at me and said in a calm, almost soothing, human voice, “Do you know why you are here?”  I timidly shook my head.  “You are here because our records show that you have been up to some suspicious activity.  You have been buying a large amount of non-perishable foods, have been observed wandering in the evenings looking up with a dream-like gaze, and you have checked out four books from the library this month all pertaining to the same theme; your latest book being one,” he looked down at the literabrary and then back up at me, “Nineteen Eighty-Four.  Do you have an explanation for any of these things?”
“I…I…” I began, still trying to understand what I had done wrong.  “Don’t be shy,” the man said still with his calm and soothing voice.  I began again, just as frightened as before.  “I…I have been buying non-perishable foods because they last…last longer in my cupboards and make a qui…quick and easy meal to eat after work.”
“And you work at the steel mill making sure all the machines are functioning properly, correct?”
“Y…yes.”
“Good. And what about the long walks staring at the sky?”
“I…I like to… to look at the stars.  They comfort me.”
“And the books?”
“I en…enjoy reading after a long hard d…day at work.  It helps me… helps me unwind at the end of the day.”
“But why books?  You can get anything government approved, on the literabrary.  So why is there a need to check out four books from the library?” His voice was still as calm as ever and yet you could hear the suspicion in it.
“I like the smell of the books, the feeling of the pages in my hands.”
“But why Those books? Why that genre?”  He leaned closer to me his eyes gleaming with intense interest.
“I…I don’t know.  Those books are classics and they…they speak to me, resonate with me somehow.  I get to follow the adventures and struggles of the characters and at the same time learn something about myself. It’s a sort of freedom from my daily life.”
He sat back in his chair and smiled a sly smile.  “That’s all we needed to hear.  Thank you.”  He closed the literabrary, and took it with him as he stood.  “Get comfortable,” he said you’re going to be here a while.”  He walked to the door and opened it.  I shouted at him, “What gives you the right to hold me here when I have done nothing wrong?”  He stopped hand still holding the door. Then he looked at me with what seemed a sad look in his eye and said calmly as ever, “I’m just trying to protect my family,” and he left the room.
