        <h1>Voice Recognition</h1>
		<h2>By Conor Leeds</h2>
        <p class="lead">“Instruction not understood, please repeat” blared out of the small speaker embedded above the door. I shouted, with my stutter, “You only have one instruction. Open door.” “Instruction not understood, please repeat.” With a sigh I sank to the ground next to the door with my head in my hands. Normally it doesn't take this long. Someone will come by and I can get through the doors. At home or at the grocery store I never have to wait more than a few minutes. At least as long as I get home before eight. A few weeks ago I had to wait over an hour to get into my apartment because I stayed late at work. But normally it was fine, someone would come by and I could get them to say “open door” for me. Not today though, I hadn’t seen a person walk down this road since I got here, early, two hours ago to be exact. I thought about calling an Uber, just get the driver to show up and say those two precious words: “Open door”. Sometimes that works, but my rating has gotten abysmally low from drivers mad that I wasn’t actually going to take the ride. Lately drivers just ignore my request and cancel the fare.</p>  
	<p>I hate being late, the stares as I enter a room, being told I need to plan things out better. I explain. Then the inevitable “doors don’t work if you have a stutter?” The surprise in their voice as they, for one minute, consider my everyday and then file it away; an interesting factoid to recall to their date later that night. It often ends with me being told I should still plan better. A dismissal of my life. A life where I plan to be at busy places. I don’t go out at night because I know I might have to stay out under the stoop until someone else wants to go into my building. My coworkers think I’m anti social because I never go drinking with them after our shift. But I just need to “plan better”. Maybe they are right. </p>
	<p>Finally I see someone walking down the small back street I’ve been sitting on for two hours now. I flag him down and stutter out “excuse me sir, could you please open this door for me, it won't work with my stutter.” He looks at me with confusion. “Doors don’t work if you have a stutter?” I nod, “please, I’m already two hours late.” He gives me a look, one I’ve come to know quite well. “Well you need to plan better to deal with your condition. Open door.” he barks out. The door slides open, he walks away looking over his shoulder. I rush inside, running down the hallway to suite 314, Voltage Industries. I burst into the office and approach the front desk. “Hello, my name is Tom, I’m here to interview with Mrs. Taylor.” The receptionist taps a few keys, scrunches her nose looking at the screen, turns and gives me a disappointed look. “I’m sorry you are twenty minutes late, you will not be considered for the position, you should plan on being more punctual in the future.”
