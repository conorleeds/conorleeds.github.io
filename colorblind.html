        <p class="lead">Being colorblind had never really been that big of a problem for Gerald. Most things end up using position or shape to deliminate as well as color. It was rare that Gerald was stopped from doing something because he couldn’t tell some colors apart. But today was one of those rare cases. Gerald stood in the massive Hall of Governance staring at the mass of grey lines on the ground. Why couldn’t it have been yellow, he could tell which lines where shades of yellow by shade sometime. But green, not a chance. He could make a guess and follow a line but it could take twenty minutes to get to the end of the line and then it could be the wrong office. Gerald was here to see the Department of Buildings to enquire about the large pit in the lot next to his house. It was dangerous, someone could fall into it and break a leg. But now he had to follow the forest green line to the department offices and that just wasn’t going to happen.
	“You look stuck, can’t find your color?” quipped a elderly woman as she walked over to the console “I’m good at finding them here all the time to get my rations adjusted.” 
	“Umm yes I’m actually color blind can you tell me which one of these lines is forest green, that's what the console told me to follow.”
	“Oh yes of course deary, this must be terribly annoying, it's that one right there, off you go” she said has Gerald walked off following the line she had pointed to.
	He walked for a good ten minutes through the twists and turns of the hall until he ran into a new problem, or perhaps the same problem. At one intersection the lines got all jumbled up as they crossed to go down different wings. Gerald couldn’t tell which was which. Stymied, Gerald followed the lines back to the entrance to see if there was some other way of getting directions. At the console Gerald spoke a new set of instructions to the machine. 
“I’m color blind do you have a different way to provide directions.”
	“Follow the mauve line to disability services for help with disabilities.”
