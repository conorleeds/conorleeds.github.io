        <h1>The Case of The People vs. Autonomobile</h1>
		<h2> By Joseph Janecek</h2>
        <p class="lead"> <i>Hello there.  Are you here for the trial? What trial!? </i> The People vs Autonomobile, <i>you know the self-driving car company.  Well if you stick with me, we might be able to see more than your average spectator.  Wow, what a beautiful building.  This is the original Courthouse you know.  It’s one of the oldest buildings in the city.  Let’s head inside, the trial is about to begin.  What’s the trial for you say?  Well there was a big accident on 101st.  Apparently the tunnel collapsed and caused a huge pile up.  Sixty people died and there were another twenty five badly injured; tragic, I know.  But I suppose you are more familiar with motor-accidents.  It’s almost a foreign idea for us, what with every autocar talking to each other.  What’s that?  Oh, um, well, all the autocars are autonomous so they can “talk” to each other by passing along their current status, whether they are about to merge or brake, stuff like that.  This means that they can move at pretty high speeds.  The average speed limit is around two hundred miles per hour.  At that rate one could get from here, New York City, to say Chicago in about four hours.  It makes traveling across the country so much easier.  And with all the autocars being underground in the tunnels, there is no need to worry about unexpected things in the road; well, I guess until last week.</i>  “All rise.” <i> Oh, shhh now, the trial is about to start, and stand up too.</i></p>
        	<p>A woman dressed in the standard judges robes entered at the front of the room. <i> Ooh that’s Judge Jacobs; she is one of the best judges in the country.  I guess it make sense that she would be the judge; there hasn’t been case like this in a long time.</i>  “You may all be seated,” said Judge Jacobs.  “Today we will begin the hearing for the People vs Autonomobile.  We will begin with opening statements, take a short recess so each side can get prepared and start again when their preparations are finished.  The prosecutor, Dr. Rebecca Tompkins, will speak first.”  Then Judge Jacobs sat down behind the bench and a tall, nicely dressed woman, stood up on the left side of the courtroom and walked to the middle facing the Jury.</p>
        	<p>“Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury,” Dr. Tompkins began, “we are here today to prove that the company, Autonomobile, knowingly sold autocars to people that were programmed in an unsafe manor.  Because of this fault, 63 people are dead and another 26 are in the hospital, severely injured.  My clients, the families of the victims of this tragedy, are asking Autonomobile to pay 5.5 million dollars for the pain and suffering they have caused.”  Dr. Tompkins returned to her seat, looking stern and ready for battle.  Judge Jacobs rose to address the court.  “Now we will hear from the defendant, Dr. Jim Renfield.” </p>
        	<p>A man, professionally dressed, stood up on the right side and also walked to the middle of the courtroom to give his statement.  “Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am here to show you that my client, Autonomobile, has broken no laws by producing their autocars,” began Dr. Renfield.  “Though this was an unfortunate tragedy, my client has done nothing wrong, and therefore, should not be forced to pay a sum to anyone because something which they are not responsible for.”  He then returned to his seat and Judge Jacobs rose again saying, “we will now have a short thirty minute recess and when we return we will call the first witness.”  She then hit her gavel on the bench to signal the beginning of the recess and everyone rose and left the courtroom.  <i>Hey you, come with me, we’ll go and see what the defendants are discussing.</i>  In one of the back rooms of the court there sat Dr. Renfield and three other people.  One of them was an older looking man dressed in a suit.  There was also woman, who looked to be around the same age as the man, who was also wearing a nice suit.  The third person was a younger man, about in his thirties, he was dressed a bit more casual than the other two but still business like. <i>The older man is the CEO of Autonomobile and the woman is the Vice President of the company.  The younger man is the senior programmer for the whole company.</i>  The older man spoke first.  “So what is our game plan, Jim?” </p>
        	<p>“Well, they are going to call the first witness.  According to their list it will be the Chief of Highway Patrol, most likely to describe the events of the accident.” Jim replied. “Then we will get to cross examine him.  Depending on the types of questions Dr. Tompkins asks him, we will ask him, and the Jury to recall the famous court case of Wheeler vs Autonomobile.  Our purpose for this is to show the people that we have improved their lives with the decisions we made based on the results of that case and start showing them that because of these decisions the autocars are completely up to safety standards.   Then we get to call our first witness.  We will be calling Dr. Jorstad, a well-known Physicist at New York University.  I am going to ask him to tell the Jury how long it takes for one of our autocars to stop when traveling at two hundred miles per hour.  This will help establish the fact that no programming could cause the crash.  Then they will call a few other witnesses and so will we.  Our goal will be to show that we violated no law or regulation in manufacturing the autocars.  Finally they will call the mother of one of the victims.  This is mostly to get the sympathy vote.  Since this accident is such a tragedy, we must play this one very carefully, so I don’t plan on cross examining her. Our next witness will be a Ms. Stoke. She is a civil engineer who works for the city.  We are going to ask her if she, or anyone in her department, could predict the tunnel collapse.  Then there will be the closing remarks and the Jury will be sent off to determine a verdict.”</p>
        	<p>“That sounds like a good plan,” said the woman.  “Thank you,” said Jim, “now we better get out there, the recess is almost over.”</p>
        	<p> <i>That’s our cue; we better head back to our seats as well. </i> “All Rise.” Judge Jacobs entered at the front of the courtroom again.  “You may all be seated.  We will start the proceeding,” Jacobs said as she hit her gavel on the bench desk and sat down.  “Dr. Tompkins you may call your first witness.”<p>
        	<p>Dr. Tompkins rose and said “We would like to call Chief Irons of the Highway Patrol to the stand.  A tall man with graying hair stood in the front row.  He was wearing a police uniform and carried his hat in his hand.  He got into the witness stand and one of the court officials brought over a small, leather bound book.  “Place your right hand on the Bible and raise your left,” said the official.  The Police Commissioner followed his instructions. </p> 
<p>“Do you swear to tell the truth and in no way intend to deceive or otherwise mislead the court by facts, true or not?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“You may proceed,” the official said to Dr. Tompkins as she approached the stand.  “Chief Irons, you were at the scene of the accident shortly after it happened correct?” </p>
<p>“Yes, I was there with the first responders.” </p>
<p>“Could you describe the event?  Tell us what happened.”</p>
<p>“Well,” the Chief began, “when I got there the whole tunnel was empty except for the pileup and the emergency responders.  This was because all the autocars were rerouted to other streets.  What appeared to have happened was the right side of the tunnel collapsed causing the entire right lane to be filled with debris.  The debris crushed two autocars flat, and there was a line of about 40 autocars all rammed together from hitting the debris.  Sticking out from the hole in the tunnel wall was what appeared to be a tree root.  We believe that the root pushed through the tunnel was causing it to collapse.” </p>
<p>“Did it seem as if any of the autocars attempted to merge or avoid the debris at all,” asked Dr. Tompkins. </p>
<p>“No it did not.” </p>
<p>“So the autocars just plowed right into the debris at full speed?” </p>
<p>“Well, some of them crashed into the debris at full speed.  However, there was evidence that many of the autocars further back did attempt to stop.”</p>
<p>“But there was no sign whatsoever that the autocars, especially the ones further back in the lane, attempting to change lanes to avoid the debris?”</p>
<p>“No, all of the autocars were crumpled straight on, there were no autocars that hit at any kind of angle.” </p>
<p>“Thank you. That will be all.”</p>
<p>Judge Jacobs said “Renfield, your witness.” Dr. Renfield stood up and approached the witness box.  “Commissioner Irons,” he said, “do you believe that the autocars intentionally rammed the debris without any attempt to avoid the crash?” </p>
        	<p>“No… Like I said, many of the autocars did try to stop before hitting.”</p>
<p>“And do you, and the Jury, recall the court case of Wheeler vs Autonomobile?”</p>
<p>“Well I wasn’t there, but I did study it in my schooling.”</p>
<p>“Could you tell us what you recall?”</p>
<p>“Sure.  Well if my memory serves correctly, it was the late 20’s and autocars were just becoming road legal but they were still fairly new to the road.  Over on the old 101st, the one on the surface, an autocar was driving along right when a kid, about ten years old, named David Wheeler stepped out into the road.  The autocar hit the brakes but was going too fast to stop in time and hit the kid.  He was very badly injured and was rushed to the hospital.  Unfortunately he died later that night.  His parents then sued Autonomobile because the autocar didn’t attempt to swerve out of the way.  The family won the case and new regulations were put in place for autocars.” </p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Renfield, “thank you Commissioner, and as a result Autonomobile partnered with the city to build the new street tunnels.  You see, the autocars were, and still are, designed to protect the driver not the pedestrian.  So by moving the autocars underground, we have solved that problem.  And by 2032 all of the old cars were replaced by autocars and the new autoways became much safer than the old road networks.  Accidents became such a rare thing that we now consider them a thing of the past. No further questions your honor.”  Dr. Renfield went and sat down. </p> 
<p>“Do you have any further questions Dr. Tompkins,” said Jacobs.</p>
<p>“No ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Then you may return to your seat Commissioner Irons.  Dr. Renfield you may now call your first witness.”</p>
        	<p>“Thank you Judge, I would like to call to the stand Dr. Jorstad of New York University.”</p>
<p>A man dressed fairly nice, wearing a suit stood up and took the stand.  The official came over and had him take the oath and Dr. Renfield approached the witness box.  “Please state your profession for the Jury,” he said. </p>
<p>“I am a professor of Physics at New York University,” answered the Doctor. </p>
<p>“And your PHD is in Physics as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“In your professional opinion, with your knowledge of an autocars braking force, how long would it take an autocar to come to a full stop from the speed limit of two hundred miles per hour?”</p>
<p>“Well, it would take approximately three seconds to stop.” </p>
<p>“And in those three seconds, how far will the autocar travel?” </p>
        	<p>“Roughly a hundred thirty four meters or about four hundred forty feet.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Doctor.” Dr. Renfield turned toward the Jury.  “So as you can see there is no amount of programming that could swerve an autocar out of the way in the three seconds it takes to stop.  I have no further questions.” Jim returned to his seat. </p> 
<p>“Your witness Dr. Tompkins” Jacobs said. </p>
<p>Dr. Tompkins approached the witness box. “Dr. Jorstad, you said that an autocar traveling that fast with the braking power that that they have would take four hundred forty feet to stop.  Could you tell us how many yards that would be?” </p>
<p>“Yes, let me see…” Dr. Jorstad sat thinking for a while.  “Around a hundred and fifty yards.”</p>
<p>“So about one and a half football fields.  How many autocars do you think could fit in one and a half football fields, keeping in mind the space between the autocars?” </p>
<p>“Hmm, well assuming the average length of an autocar is about fifteen feet and including the nine feet space between autocars that is legally required, I would say about twenty autocars could fit in that space.” </p>
<p>“And yet nearly twice that many cars were involved in the accident.  Thank you Doctor, no further questions.” </p>
<p>Judge Jacobs asked Dr. Renfield if he had any more questions for the Doctor.  He didn’t so Jacobs sent Dr. Jorstad to his seat and allowed Dr. Tompkins to call her next witness.  Both Dr. Tompkins and Dr. Renfield called several witnesses in this time.  Those that Tompkins called discussed things like the morality of the cars not swerving and suggested that many of the cars could have stopped in time.  The people that Renfield called were mostly technical people, who discussed how the cars worked and what standards the law requires the autocars to meet before they can be sold.  Finally it was Dr. Tompkins turn to call her last witness. “I would like to call Mrs. Agular to the stand,” said Tompkins.  A young looking woman then stood up and walked to the stand and sat down.  She looked as if she had been crying and she kept wiping her eyes with a handkerchief that she held in her hand.  After the official had her take the oath Dr. Tompkins approached the stand and gently asked “Mrs. Agular, could you please inform the court why you are here?” </p>
<p>“Yes,” the woman said with a slight tremor in her voice. “My daughter was one of the victims of the accident.” She sniffled and wiped her eyes with the handkerchief, but you could tell that she was trying to keep it together. </p>
<p>“And if you don’t mind would you tell us a little about your daughter?” </p>
<p>“Her name was Peggy.  She…She was fifteen years old, a very smart kid.  She always did her homework and got good grades in school.  She helped out at our church on Sundays and volunteered at the animal shelter on Thursday afternoons.  She wanted to study to become a veteri…” her voice trailed off and she looked down but didn’t cry.  <i>You can tell she’s trying really hard not to cry, she’s trying to be strong for her daughter. </i> </p>
<p>“That’s alright Mrs. Agular.  Thank you.”  Tompkins turned toward the Jury.  “Mrs. Agular has lost her daughter in a horrible autocar accident.  Peggy’s car was found near the end of the pileup, well out into the stopping distance for the autocar, as Dr. Jorstad demonstrated.  Mrs. Agular, how long have you had an Autonomobile autocar?”</p>
<p>“Well,” the woman answered raising her head to look at Dr. Tompkins, “we have always had Autonomobile autocars.  Autonomobile is the oldest manufacturer of autocars and so we have always chosen them because they have a great reputation for being reliable.” </p>
<p>“So would you say that you trusted you autocar to get your daughter home safe.” </p>
<p>“Well of course, don’t you?” </p>
<p>“I do indeed.  Thank you Mrs. Agular that will be all.”</p>
<p>Jacobs then informed Dr. Renfield that the witness was his to cross examine.  He stood up but did not approach the stand.  “I am sorry for your loss Mrs. Agular,” he said in a very gentle voice, “it is a real tragedy that we are facing.  I can’t imagine the pain you are going through.  However this was an accident,” he turned to the Jury.  “It is not our fault but…” </p>
<p>“Not your fault,” she shouted interrupting him.  “It was your damn autocar that drove my sweet girl into a pile of mangled metal and flames!” </p>
<p>“There is no need to…”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t your autocar stop in time?  Why did my daughter have to die?”</p>
<p>Dr. Renfield raised his voice.  “I have no questions,” he said and sat down.</p>
<p>“No questions,” exclaimed the woman.  “How dare you! You weasel! You killed my daughter.  You heartless monster! You bas …” She trailed off as a few of the court guards escorted her to a back room so that the trial could continue.  Jim Renfield sat perfectly still and took the abuse.  Then one of the representatives of Autonomobile who sat with him got up and whispered something in his ear.  It was the younger man who was in the room with him during the recess. <i> Would you like to hear what they are saying? Here. </i> “Come on Donny calm down it will be fine,” Jim was whispering.  “Please, I need to talk to you just call for a recess,” the other man replied.  “Fine,” Jim said slightly annoyed. </p>
<p>“You may call your next witness Dr. Renfield,” said Judge Jacobs.  Jim stood up and replied, “Actually your honor, I would like to request a quick recess so we may re-compose ourselves.” </p>
<p>“Fine we will have a ten minute recess.  Court adjourned.”  Jacobs replied hitting her gavel on the bench desk again.  Everyone excited the room. <i> Hey, let’s go find out why they wanted a recess. </i> Back in the back room there were only Jim Renfield and the younger man talking with each other.  “I can’t take this Jim!  I can’t shake the feeling that we did something wrong,” the younger man was saying. </p>
<p>“We have done nothing wrong Donny, we didn’t break any law or regulation,” Jim replied. <i> Ooh this is getting good. I’m going to go get us some popcorn. </i> </p>
<p>“People died Jim, a lot of people.” </p>
<p>“People die, that’s what happens.  It’s a natural part of life.”</p>
<p>“But we are responsible, those autocars were programmed to protect the driver, and this means that if it couldn’t swerve out of the way, it would attempt to break but it wouldn’t try swerving.  Since the autocars had nowhere to go they just plowed into whatever was in front of them.” </p>
<p>“Yes, and that was the problem that caused Wheeler vs Autonomobile, that’s why we built the underground autoways.  And look at what it resulted in.”  Jim went to the window and pointed out.  “Look at all the parks, the trees! We uprooted the pavement and planted beautiful gardens!  Look how clean the air is!  You can see for miles on a sunny day.  Air pollution is a thing of the past.  People don’t go on Sunday drives anymore.  Instead the go for runs or walks under the trees.  People even ride horses through the city again.  Ivy is climbing up the Empire State building which just makes it look even more beautiful.  We did this Donny, we did this.” </p>
<p>“Yes, moving the autocars underground did wonderful things.  Making them all electric, running on power being fed to them by the tunnel has helped reduce pollution.  But look at what we have just done.”  Donny threw a stack of photos onto the table.  “Look at the carnage we have caused.  Do you think that we couldn’t have saved more people?” </p>
<p>“We followed the regulations, and the law.  We did nothing legally wrong.” </p>
<p>“But what about morally wrong!?”</p>
<p>“You want to talk about morals!?  We have saved more lives by changing the way vehicles work than have died in this crash.  When I was a kid hundreds of people died in car accidents every day.  That rate has dropped to nearly one hundred percent because of the autocar.”</p>
<p>“Look at this woman Jim!”  Donny pointed to a picture on the table of Mrs. Agular.  “Look at her!  She is in pain and grief and we could have prevented this.  You can’t tell me you don’t feel anything when you look at her grieving face.”</p>
<p>“I am incredibly saddened by this event, however we are not responsible.  Now you will get a hold of yourself because I am not going to lose this case just so you can sleep at night!  Now let’s get back out there; the trial is about to begin again.”</p>

<p>Back in the courtroom Judge Jacobs returned and she started the trial again.  “Dr. Renfield, you may call your final witness,” she said.</p>
<p>Jim stood up and said “I would like to call Ms. Stoke to the stand.”  An older woman perhaps in her mid-forties stood up and took the stand.</p>
<p>Jim approached the witness box and asked her, “Please state your profession for the Jury.”</p>
<p>“I am the chief civil engineer for the city of New York.”</p>
<p>“And have you ever done an inspection on the autoway tunnels?”</p>
<p>“Yes we do an inspection of all the tunnels once every two years.”</p>
<p>“And when was the last time you inspected the 101st street tunnel?”</p>
<p>“It was about a year ago”</p>
<p>“And were there any signs that the tunnel might collapse, such as cracks in the walls or anything like that?</p>
<p>“No, if there were we would have repaired and reinforced the tunnel immediately.”</p>
<p>“Thank you Ms. Stoke.  As you can see, there was no way for us, or anyone to predict that the tunnel would collapse, further leading to the conclusion that this unfortunate accident was just that, an accident and nothing more.”</p>
<p>It was now Dr. Tompkins turn to ask Ms. Stoke some questions. “Ms. Stoke,” she began, “As a civil engineer for the city you must have a basic understanding of how tree roots can crack concrete and bend steel, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we deal with repairs to many buildings and tunnels that have been damaged by tree roots.”</p>
<p>“So what you’re saying is that it is not uncommon to need to repair tunnels due to tree root damage?”</p>
<p>“No, however the damage is usually minimal.  Not like this collapse at all.”</p>
<p>“But clearly a collapse of this magnitude is possible.  Now do you think that it is possible that there were signs of the damage to the tunnel that appeared shortly after your inspection?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose that it is likely.”</p>
<p>“Thank you that is all.”  Dr. Tompkins turned toward the Jury.  “As you can see, though there were no signs of the damage at the time of the inspection, damage to the autoway tunnels does occur from time to time, so to say that no one could foresee this happening is a bit of a stretch. That will be all.”</p>
<p>Jim was given one more opportunity to ask a few more questions of Ms. Stoke but he declined.  “If that is all the witnesses,” declared Judge Jacobs, “then we will hear the final remarks.  Dr. Tompkins, you may go first.”</p>
<p>Dr. Tompkins again stood in the middle of the courtroom to address the Jury.  “People of the Jury, we have heard a lot of facts about what happened and what resulted from this terrible accident.  However, many of the facts that Autonomobile has claimed to be true have not held up under further scrutiny.  Nearly half of the cars in the accident could have stopped well before crashing into the debris.  Because of this and several other discrepancies that have been brought forth, I believe, and hope that I have proven to you, that Autonomobile is, in fact, at fault and should pay the amount that is asked of them.  Thank you.”  Dr. Tompkins then returned to her seat and Jim got up and moved toward the center of the room. </p>
<p>“Ladies and Gentleman of the Jury, my opponent has attempted to play on your emotions in order to prove her point.  However, this is a court of law, and therefore we are concerned with whether or not Autonomobile has broken any law by selling their autocars.  We have heard from several officials from the Federal Autocar Department on what the current regulations for autocars are.  Now we have shown you that by developing their autocars, my client has broken no law or any regulation.  I hope then, that you realize that though this was a terrible event, it is merely a tragic accident in which no party is at fault. Thank you,” and Jim took his seat.</p>
 	<p>Judge Jacobs rose and declared, “With those closing remarks I now send the Jury out to make a decision.”  The members of the Jury all stood up and followed a court official out of a door located on the backside of the courtroom.  They returned in about half an hour and the court was called in to receive the verdict.  “Members of the Jury, have you reached a verdict,” asked Jacobs.</p>
<p>A woman at the end of the Jury box stood up and said, “Yes, though it is not unanimous. We have decided that Autonomobile has not broken any law or regulation in the manufacturing of their autocars and therefore do not need to pay the settlement.  With that being said however, we do believe that the regulations and laws required for manufacturing must be updated to reflect the recent advances in the industry and prevent an accident of this scale again.”  The woman sat down again and Judge Jacobs stood and exclaimed “Then the case is settled.  Autonomobile is found not at fault. Court is now adjourned.”  She then hit her gavel on the bench desk and everyone was dismissed from the courtroom.</p>
<p> <i>Oh hey!  There you are!  I thought I lost you.  I’m glad you found me again.  Did you enjoy the trial?  Whether it was the right decision or not, I hope you found it exciting.  You may be wondering why we are out here by this tree.  Well this is the tree whose root caused the tunnel collapse.  Beautiful tree isn’t it.  It is very old and strong now.  But did you notice the plaque at the base here. </i> The plaque reads:  <b>Planted In Memory of David Wheeler: You will always be in our hearts.</b>
