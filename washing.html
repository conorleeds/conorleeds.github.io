        <p class="lead">Almost out out of wet wipes. I would need to have more delivered. They aren’t environmentally friendly but what's a guy to do. When you have dark skin like mine you have to find a way to wash your hands. See, those fancy automatic faucets, they don’t work if you have dark pigmented skin. Ever since they started installing them, it has been a pain for me. At first it would just be here or there, the grocery store around the corner put one in first. Then my high school got them. They save water and are more sanitary. . . how great for the world. That's when I started carrying wet wipes with me for the bathroom. Then the water fountains were changed. For the first few weeks I went thirsty, but I figured that out too, just had to bring a big jug of water with me to school. All the athletes did that anyways so it wasn’t that weird I guess.
	The real problems happened when it was time to move out of my parents house. Most of the nice apartments had already been “upgraded” by this point. I had a good job lined up and could have afforded something nice. Something close to work in Manhattan. Eventually I settled for a little prewar building in Brooklyn. It wasn’t really what I wanted but it was the nicest place I could find that still had faucets I could use. It added some time to my commute that most of my coworkers didn’t have to deal with. Well at least the white ones. I guess my problem is pretty common among my black colleagues. One of my friends drives in from Jersey. . . Jersey, to have an old faucet. I talked to one of the people that worked on some of the code for the faucets. I guess all of the companies that make them just reuse the same sensor code and they don’t like to change it. See the sensor only triggers when it gets a certain amount of infrared that is bounced back by a hand. Apparently, when the code was calibrated they only used the developers as testers. I think we all know how that went.
	Anyway after using the last of my wipes I went back to my desk and managed to plow through my reports and get out by five. A good day all and all. I hopped on the subway to head home; it had been fairly hot today so I was almost out of water. I drained my jug with a long pull and pulled out less than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis, for my ride home. Once I got home, there was a note taped to my door, from maintenance. I grabbed it and hurried inside, desperate for a nice cold glass of water. But as I entered my kitchen I stopped dead. An automatic faucet sat in place of my old fashioned one. I glanced at the paper in my hand: “Hello apartment 321 tenant, we’ve upgraded your faucets and shower to nicer automatic versions. Have a wonderful day!” I sat down on the floor. Could I get them to change it back? Probably not. Would I have to move to Jersey. . . Fucking Jersey.</p>
