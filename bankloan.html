        <p class="lead">Yuki had spent the last three weeks preparing for her visit to the bank. You had to have all of your ducks in a row if you wanted your loan application to succeed. Your business plan needs to be meticulous, and formatted correctly. Yuki had been meticulous, dotting every i and crossing every t. The bank would dig into her past, but her past was clean. A degree in business from Tokyo University and no criminal history. She had also been very careful with her chat history over the last few years. They make you turn that over as well. It’s been difficult to get loans since the downturn in the economy. But Yuki’s Gun & Video Emporium was going to get funded for sure. How could it not, guns are the most desired commodity nowadays with the mercenary gangs running around. Also who doesn’t love movies. There was no way that Yuki’s loan application would be rejected.
	The bank is practically a fortress, surrounded by concrete walls and barbed wire. There are guard towers at every corner. It looks like a prison. Yuki confidently walked up to the foot traffic entrance, the driveway was for big shots. “What’s your business today” the guard challenged, boredom etched across his face. “I’m here to see about a loan, just a small business start up, below the walk in cap”. The guard, 4261 by his identification tag, looked Yuki up and down, probably scanning her for weapons. He jerked his head towards the inner yard pointing Yuki towards the entrance. It was a good hundred yards to the entrance, and Yuki walked it with confidence, going over her pitch in her head, in case the machine flagged her for in person scrutiny. Her paper work should be enough but sometime people missed something the banks care about.
	Yuki ducked into the first available booth and sat at the console to begin the loan application, it can take several hours to fill out all the relevant information. You have to log the system into your social media, fill out your medical and rental histories. Enter your school transcripts and scan your business plan in. Then you have to go through and correct any mistakes the scanner made. It would be a shame to be rejected because you missed a spelling error introduced by the machine. Four hours later, after checking her work one final time, Yuki initiated the biometric identification. A scanner descended from the ceiling and swept across Yuki’s face. “Please fully open your eyes for identification” blared from a speaker behind the console. Yuki sighed, “always with the eyes” she muttered as she reached up to pull her eyelids further apart. “Remove your hands from your face to complete the scan”.
